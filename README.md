<b>General:</b>

This website was a very straight forward restaurant website where the main page and menu were esay to get down, the user-experience pages were a little hard to come up with (about page and location pages). Other than that, our team worked great together for the most part and we were efficent at doing and testing the things we wanted to see in our website. Were looking forward to competing with the other teams in this competition.
